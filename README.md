# UpYourToyProblemGame
Resources for a talk for Hack Reactor Students about options for running toy problem code for testing before submission.

### Better ways to test:
- Chrome console
- Script Tags
- Node
- Snippets

#### More on Node Bulid systems
http://sublimetext.info/docs/en/reference/build_systems.html

#### Other things to look into
- node --debug-brk
- Sublime Web Inspector
- Visual Studio Code
- Atom
- Don't just stop at these things, or do because you don't want to waste your time constantly figuring out how to set up a new IDE/editor/bulid system
